              We saw it happen around us. Bright students pulling away. Friends
              too afraid to speak up. Young people struggling to make it through
              the The problem wasn’t just the struggle—it was the silence around
              it. Mental health wasn’t being talked about in schools. Not in
              classrooms, not in assemblies, and definitely not in a way that
              felt safe or normal “What if there was a space where you didn’t
              have to hide how you feel?”
